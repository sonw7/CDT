/**
 * A temporary package providing tools from the JTS Topology Suite.
 * The DD class included in this package was modified from the
 * JTS 1.13 release.  While the changes were submitted to (and accepted by)
 * the project, they were not yet part of the standard distribution
 * when this package was created.
 * Source code for JTS can be accessed at
 * <a href="https://github.com/locationtech/jts">JTS Topology Suite</a>.
 * The package name user here is slightly different to avoid name-space
 * conflicts in applications that use the standard JTS API.
