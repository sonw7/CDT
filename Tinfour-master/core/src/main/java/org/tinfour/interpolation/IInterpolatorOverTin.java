     * To improve performance, classes that implement this interface
     * frequently maintain state data about the TIN that can be reused
     * for query to query.  They also avoid run-time overhead by not
     * implementing any kind of Java synchronization or or even the
     * concurrent-modification testing provided by the
     * Java collection classes.   If an application modifies the TIN, instances
     * of this class will not be aware of the change. In such cases,
     * interpolation methods may fail by either throwing an exception or,
     * worse, returning an incorrect value. The onus is on the calling
     * application to manage the use of this class and to ensure that
     * no modifications are made to the TIN between interpolation operations.
     * If the TIN is modified, the internal state data for this class must
     * be reset using a call to resetForChangeToTin() defined in the
     * IProcessUsingTin interface.
     * @param x the x coordinate for the interpolation point
     * @param y the y coordinate for the interpolation point
     * @param valuator a valid valuator for interpreting the z value of each
     * vertex or a null value to use the default.
     * @return if the interpolation is successful, a valid floating point
     * value; otherwise, a NaN.
