/**
 * An interface for specifying methods of accessing a value
 * from a Vertex.
 * <p>Clearly, the most straight-forward way to create a surface from a sample
 * of vertices is by accessing their Z coordinates. But in cases where a 
 * derived value is required, or where a value needs to be computed using
 * information available to the application but outside the scope of the
 * TIN implementation, this interface provides a mechanism for doing so. 
 * <h1>Development Notes</h1>
 * <p>For a default implementation, see the VertexValuatorGetZ class.
 * <p>The functionality provided by this interface seems like a natural 
 * candidate for  the Java closure concept introduced with Java 8. 
 * At the time of this implementation, Java 8 is only a few months old
 * and not yet in wide use. This design decision may be revisited later.
